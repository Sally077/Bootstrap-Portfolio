# <Bootstrap Portfolio>

## Description

The main focus of my task was to create a portfolio using bootstrap framework.

Within this task there were various sub-tasks that I needed to perform to meet the user requirements.

Creating a specific file structure and a new github repository.
Expectations were that I used HTML, style sheets and bootstrap.

The website was expected to have the following:

A navigation bar with links to my portfolio and a menu.
A hero section with my name and other information about me.

A work section displaying work using a grid with links to work or a placeholder and a brief overview of work tasks I have completed.

A skills section that lists my expectations of the skills in bootcamp.

An about me section with a footer and contact details.

In addition to the content I was also asked to give all hyperlinks a hover effect and any buttons to display a box shadow upon the hover. Expectations are that the bootstrap portfolio should limit the use of media queries and I should deploy this to github whilst regularly commiting my work to the site.


I did stick to the content but as I really wanted to push my skills to the next level I focused on creating a feature piece for this portfolio. My main focus was to create an expandable carousel for my skills section.

I did struggle with this and had to rely heavily on a video tutorial but was very please with the outcome. I had issues with lining up my objects into columns firstly getting my html structure wrong as not indenting properly but one maiin issue was that I had named the section incorrectly once this was rectified the rows in my footer lined up.

I still need to get to grips with layouts and alignments but really feel that my new skills are coming together and this is the best piece of work I have produced so far.

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

My code does not currently need an install and can be viewed directly through the URL.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

## Tests

I ran my carousel test by loading the web page and checking that when I clicked on the images it ran through effectively the first few times this did not work and I realised that the JS code that I added from the cloudflare link was not added to the correct place in HTML, once adjusted I tested again and this worked perfectly.
